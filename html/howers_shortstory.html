        <h1>Pooey's Choice</h1>
        (A tragic story about Pooey Prickles, famous Crabtown scientist who was murdered by the evil Mr Pineapple Head during last years Crabtown Cup. Please be advised it contains references to deceased crabs). 
        <br>
        <br>
    <article>
    <p>
    Pooey stared at the fly in his glass, helplessly trying to keep afloat in the water. He observed the frantic spasming of its arms and legs with a morbid curiosity, and wondered what the fly was thinking, if anything. He wondered if their lives flashed before them just before death in a highlight reel of their proudest moments, like what they say about us, except he couldn’t quite imagine what an episode of “This Is Your Life” would look like for a fly, especially considering their lifespans were less than a month. What about himself? They’d probably have some sort of memorial for him when he died. Pooey Prickles, beloved CEO and chemical engineer of the one and only ‘’Extendalife” – the wonder-drug proven to extend life forever...
    <br>
    “Mr Prickles, the new intern from Crabvard is here to see you.” His assistant spoke quietly from behind the oak double doors into his office, her tiny head barely visible through the gap.
    <br>
    “That was today? Alright send him in.” Pooey lifted himself from his chair; his best years were behind him.
    <br>
    A tall and handsome Crab in a tailored suit appeared from the gap, a grin on his smug face as he introduced himself to Pooey: “Sir my name is Hower. It is an honour to work at your company, its accomplishments and fortune is nothing short of incredi-“
    <br>
    Yes that’s quite alright; let’s get on with this.” Pooey had dealt with enough kowtowers to spot them a mile away, and frankly he’d rather have gone back to staring at his desk than lead another intern through the same tour he’d given hundreds of times before. Nonetheless, Pooey guided the man (who clearly wanted to engage in some banter before continuing) into the company’s internal museum (a narrow hallway) and began the tour. 
    </p><p>
    “This was my laboratory microscope, where my partner and I, working on our doctorates, discovered the chemical makeup that was the first iteration of “Extendalife.” The antique looked like it was going to collapse. “The process of synthesising such a complex compound took several months of our lives away. Creating a product which had no harmful side-effects was extremely difficult, but necessary if we ever wanted to put it on the market.” <br>
    “Your ingenuity is renown, sir, it’s a shame Ms Marbles and yourself did not see eye-to-eye.” <br>
    Pooey nodded. “Poppin and I could not get along, and she eventually left the company. Shame.” The words came from his mouth exactly as he had said it the previous hundred times – people always gave the same remarks, and he always gave the same responses. But for some reason, in this particular instance he found it difficult lying. The next few minutes were spent navigating down the dimly lit hall, passing various photographs of himself and his employees, the company’s progression evident in the increasingly grandiose photographs. As he led the intern down the timeline of his life, his mind became obsessed with the final conversation he and Marbles had together. The yelling and arguing played itself in his mind again and again like a broken record, each word filling him with regret. As they were nearing the end of the hallway, he noticed her. Yet it wasn’t her, not really, Poppin was long gone now, but as Pooey saw it, a perfect still of her, and their love, captured in time. He hadn’t seen her in years, but the mere image filled him with intense sadness.  Somewhere along the way he forgot what he wanted in the first place, and the only thing that mattered anymore was this empire he had built. Their final conversation played once again in his mind. “You don’t understand, it’s a necessary compromise. … The pain is unbearable, I’m doing them a favour! … No that’s not what I’m saying. Someday you’ll understand. This company will support our children. I’m doing this for our family.” “Our family”, the words echoed in his head.
    </p><p>
    The tour ended and Pooey returned to his office. He slowly seated himself back into his chair, using his armrests for support. The fly was no longer in the glass. Somehow, in the final moments of its life it had managed to escape. To the right of the glass, lying face-up on his desk, Pooey saw its lifeless body illuminated in the sun’s rays. Its final moments were spent trying to reach the sunlight. Pooey looked at the fly for a moment. Taking a deep breath, he called his assistant in. “Stop all production immediately – “Extendalife reduces fertility. Anyone who has taken the drug regularly for years will have an increased risk of losing their Marbles. Notify the public, I’m finished.”
